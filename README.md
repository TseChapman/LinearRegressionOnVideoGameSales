# LinearRegressionOnVideoGameSales

## Abstract

In recent years, the video game industry had rapidly expanded.
Unfortunately, not all video game publishes grant game developers
enough revenue in comparison to the efforts they made. This 
situation leaves developers wonder what kind of game elements 
could result in higher game sales. The goal of the model presented 
in this paper is to perform linear regression on predicting video 
game sales in North America. The model could hint correlation 
between model features and sales in North America. The paper 
used linear regression model from sklearn to train and 
predict North America sales.

## Introduction

Starting on 2015, the video game industry had rapidly expanded. 
In 2021, there are 10,394 games published on Steam, one of the 
biggest online game stores [1]. In comparison, there are only 1,582 
games published on Stream during 2015. The increase publishes of 
video game significantly impel the expansion of the video game 
industry. Unfortunately, not all video game publishes grant game 
developers enough revenue in comparison to the efforts they made. 
In fact, 50% of indie games published on Steam never made more 
than $4,000 [2]. Therefore, game developers are longing for a 
model that can finding the features that have positive impact on 
video game revenue. In this paper, linear regression model is 
performed to predict a gameâ€™s revenue within the North America 
region.
